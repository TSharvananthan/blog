## Overview

I was doing my daily session of grazing LinkedIn and reading my empty DMs, when I saw this post

![A long joke that if you can't see, you should click off before any more of your time is wasted.](/post-assets/12345678/1.png)

There's something about these kind of posts that... anyways...

It had me wondering. Let's say that the candidate has some valuable information in his email. I don't know... he owns the Leafs, and I would like to find out why they keep losing in the first round.

If I were the interviewer and I (for some reason), wanted to access the candidate's email, how many passwords would I need to go through in order to find the correct one.

## Assumptions

### Every Password Only Takes Unicode Characters.

I'd like to restrict the possible characters that could be used as a password.

At the same time, it's a common character code that's used by all forms of websites.

In other words, useful for me.

### Every Password Has Some Representation Of Numbers 1-8 Ascending

It's easier.

Sure, I can't be nearly as creative and come up with stuff like 2444666668888888 (one 2, three 4s, five 6, seven 8s).

However, it's easier.

At the same time, it's hard to quantify a password like the above. There really isn't a process to calculate a password like that.

## The Process

There's really only a couple steps that I'd need to take in order for this to work.

### Step 1: Collect the Representations of Every Number From 1 to 8

### Step 2: Compute the Combinations

### Step 3: Count The Number of Combinations

## A Primer On Set Theory

Set theory is rather useful here given that it allows me to quantify a collection of representations.

Here's a quick run through of what sets are and the applications I choose to use for this problem.

If you're aware of basic sets, cardinality and cartesian product, feel free to skip to [here]().

### What Is A Set?

A set is any mathematical model for a collection of objects. A set can represent anything and is often enclosed between $$\{~\}$$.

For example, the numbers 1 to 10 can be represented as $$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$

There are also some well defined sets.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Number Type</th>
            <th>Symbol</th>
            <th>Set Of Numbers</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Natural Numbers</td>
            <td>$$\mathbb{N}$$</td>
            <td>$$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...\}$$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Whole Numbers</td>
            <td>$$\mathbb{W}$$</td>
            <td>$$\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...\}$$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Integers</td>
            <td>$$\mathbb{Z}$$</td>
            <td>$$\{...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...\}$$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rational</td>
            <td>$$\mathbb{Q}$$</td>
            <td>$$\{\frac{7}{8}, -3.4, 9.45454545, \frac{3}{4}...\}$$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Real Numbers</td>
            <td>$$\mathbb{R}$$</td>
            <td>$$\{\pi, e, -2\pi\}$$</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

I will be making use of sets throughout this post. Specifically, there are two properties that will be useful for this situation.

### Cardinality

Cardinality refers to the number of objects that exists in a set.

For example,

$$S=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$

The cardinality of $$S$$ is 10.

### Cartesian Product

Let's say I have to go outside and I need to choose a shirt and a pair of jeans to wear.

I know that I have a red, blue and white shirt. I also know that I have blue and black jeans.

I can represent the possible shirts I have in a set $$S=\{Red,Blue,White\}$$

I can ALSO represent the possible jeans I have in another set $$J=\{Blue,Black\}$$

My question now is, _how many shirt/jean combinations can I make?_

The Cartesian Product in essence, asks this question.

The Cartesian Product is a set that represents the number of ways one can pull from multiple sets.

The only condition is that you **must** pull from each set once.

<figcaption>A way of visualizing every combination.</figcaption>

Let's extend this idea a bit further.

I know that the cardinality of $$S$$ is 3 and the cardinality of $$J$$ is 2.

By multiplying both values, I get 6 possible combinations.

In other words, the Cartesian Product returns a set of combinations.

Multiplying the cardinalities of both sets returns the cardinality of their Cartesian Product.

Now that both concepts are out of the way, it's time that we get into the math.

## Step 1

The question that this step looks to answer is... "how can I represent numbers 1 to 8?"

We can clear out the numerical representations. In other words: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Another way is through words. In other words: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight.

HOWEVER, this raises two concerns:

### How about capital letters?

Since we have a concerete idea of what a capital letter is, there isn't much to worry about in this department.

### Aren't there other ways of representing letters?

Take the letter "O". What stops us from representing them with a zero?

That's right... nothing.

These are called [homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph)

There currently exists a [list of homoglyphs for every Unicode character](https://github.com/yamatt/homoglyphs/blob/main/homoglyphs_fork/confusables.json). I can take from this.

All that I need are:
_ Capital letter confusables
_ Lowercase letter confusables \* Number confusables

This can be done with a few lines of Python.

```py
import json
import string

confusables = json.load(open("confusables.json"))
letters = string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase

needed_confusables = {}

for char in letters:
    needed_confusables[char] = confusables[char] + confusables[char.upper()]

for digit in string.digits:
    needed_confusables[digit] = confusables[digit]
```

### Representing The Same Words

Now that I have the needed confusables, it's possible to begin modelling this situation.

Below is a table for the number of confusables that each character has.

```
'a' = 49     'b' = 46     'c' = 48     'd' = 38
'e' = 47     'f' = 42     'g' = 35     'h' = 43
'i' = 38     'j' = 37     'k' = 40     'l' = 96
'm' = 31     'n' = 38     'o' = 120    'p' = 55
'q' = 30     'r' = 40     's' = 42     't' = 45
'u' = 49     'v' = 55     'w' = 41     'x' = 58
'y' = 60     'z' = 41

'A' = 52     'B' = 56     'C' = 54     'D' = 38
'E' = 56     'F' = 48     'G' = 34     'H' = 52
'I' = 2      'J' = 40     'K' = 54     'L' = 48
'M' = 60     'N' = 46     'O' = 90     'P' = 52
'Q' = 28     'R' = 42     'S' = 44     'T' = 64
'U' = 44     'V' = 52     'W' = 38     'X' = 70
'Y' = 60     'Z' = 50

'0' = 1      '1' = 1      '2' = 11     '3' = 15
'4' = 7      '5' = 7      '6' = 9      '7' = 8
'8' = 12     '9' = 14
```

From here, I can get

## Step 2

## Step 3
