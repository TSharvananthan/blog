I like looking back.

There's something about seeing how far you've come.

More imporantly, I like looking back at really bad code that I once wrote.

I feel proud knowing that I no longer write that kind of terrible code.

It's the sorta process that always repeats.

Three years down the line, I would be doing the same thing and look down at student me.

During my browse however, I discovered some truely abismal code that I would like to code.

## Don't Repeat Yourself... without the Don't.

What if I told you that I repeated myself **30** times in one project.

I'm a big Leafs fan for context. So at one point in time, I wanted to simulate their games.

So like any reasonable person, I pulled out the number of times

```py
while len(schedule) > 0:
    try:
        if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
            if len(schedule) == 0:
                break
            if determinesawinornot > 95:
                print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Lost")
                schedule.pop(0)
                leafslosses += 1
                teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
                determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
            else:
                print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Won")
                schedule.pop(0)
                leafswins += 1
                teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
                determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
            game += 1
            continue

		[...]

        if teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
            if len(schedule) == 0:
                break
            if determinesawinornot > 95:
                print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Lost")
                schedule.pop(0)
                leafslosses += 1
                teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
                determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
            else:
                print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Won")
                schedule.pop(0)
                leafswins += 1
                teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
                determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
            game += 1
            continue
    except IndexError:
        break
```

Let's clear some unneeded lines.

```py
if len(schedule) == 0:
	break
```

There's no point in including this given that the while loop already checks for this.

```py
schedule.pop(0)
teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
```

These lines don't need to be included twice.

The code can be written as the following.

```py
if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
	if determinesawinornot > 95:
		print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Lost")
		leafslosses += 1
	else:
		print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Won")
		leafswins += 1

	schedule.pop(0)
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
	game += 1
	continue
```

Yet, that's only the beginning.

```py
schedule.pop(0)
teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
game += 1
continue
```

I can remove the `continue` clause and add the first four lines accordingly...

```py
while len(schedule) > 0:
    try:
		teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
		determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

		if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
			if determinesawinornot > 95:
				print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Lost")
				leafslosses += 1
			else:
				print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Won")
				leafswins += 1

		[...]

		if teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
			if determinesawinornot > 95:
				print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Lost")
				leafslosses += 1
			else:
				print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Won")
				leafswins += 1

		game += 1
		schedule.pop(0)

    except IndexError:
        break
```

Note that I chose to include the process of selecting a team and choosing a random number at the top since it avoids any IndexError as the loop would break the moment the last item is removed from the list.

Knowing that, I can remove the try, except clause.

```
while len(schedule) > 0:
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

	if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
		if determinesawinornot > 95:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Lost")
			leafslosses += 1
		else:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Won")
			leafswins += 1

	[...]

	if teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
		if determinesawinornot > 95:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Lost")
			leafslosses += 1
		else:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Won")
			leafswins += 1

	game += 1
	schedule.pop(0)
```

This project took up 560 lines. However, these small changes reduced the program to 270 lines.

(note that from here on out, I will be using line counts to gague significant improvements to the program. )

Another change that I could make is the following.

Note this string.

```py
print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Lost")
```

This appears a whopping 58 times throughout my code.

Let's note the content of the string.

```
			   ----- The game variable         ------- The team variable
			   |                               |
print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Lost")
                                                                  |
																  ------ Whether I won or lost
```

I can rewrite this as an f-string.

```py
print(f"Game {game} Was Played Against The {teambeingplayed} The Leafs {iswon}")
```

The one issue is that I don't have a variable to handle whether the team won or lost.

This can be solved with a flag.

```py
while len(schedule) > 0:
	iswon = False
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

	if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
		if determinesawinornot > 95:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Lost")
			leafslosses += 1
		else:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Anaheim Ducks", "The Leafs Won")
			leafswins += 1

	[...]

	if teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
		if determinesawinornot > 95:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Lost")
			leafslosses += 1
		else:
			print("Game", game, "Was Played Against The Winnipeg Jets", "The Leafs Won")
			leafswins += 1

	game += 1
	schedule.pop(0)
```

Furthermore, we can remove the `print` statements and add one at the very end.

```py
while len(schedule) > 0:
	iswon = False
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

	if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
		if determinesawinornot > 95:
			leafslosses += 1
		else:
			leafswins += 1

	[...]

	if teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
		if determinesawinornot > 95:
			leafslosses += 1
		else:
			leafswins += 1

	game += 1
	schedule.pop(0)
	print(f'Game {game} Was Played Against The {teambeingplayed} The Leafs {"Won" if iswon else "Lost"}')
```

The next question is... how do we set the flag?

Note `determinesawinornot > [some number]`. This is what determines if there's a win or a loss.

So why not set it to the flag?

```py
while len(schedule) > 0:
	iswon = False
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

	if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	[...]

	if teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	game += 1
	schedule.pop(0)
	print(f'Game {game} Was Played Against The {teambeingplayed} The Leafs {"Won" if iswon else "Lost"}')
```

In order to tally wins/losses, we can do a simple check at the end of the code.

```py
while len(schedule) > 0:
	iswon = False
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

	if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	[...]

	if teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	if iswon:
		leafslosses += 1

	else:
		leafswins += 1

	game += 1
	schedule.pop(0)
	print(f'Game {game} Was Played Against The {teambeingplayed} The Leafs {"Won" if iswon else "Lost"}')
```

At this point, I've gone from 270 lines to 134 lines.

One last minor switch that I would do is add `elif` clauses.

```py
while len(schedule) > 0:
	iswon = False
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

	if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	[...]

	elif teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	if iswon:
		leafslosses += 1

	else:
		leafswins += 1

	game += 1
	schedule.pop(0)
	print(f'Game {game} Was Played Against The {teambeingplayed} The Leafs {"Won" if iswon else "Lost"}')
```

At this point, the nightmarish aspect of this project is done. Yet, the further I look at the code, the more I see that I could fix.

Let me show the rest of the code.

```py
import random
from os import system
from time import sleep #used for some aesthetics and style

teams = ["Anaheim Ducks","Arizona Coyotes","Boston Bruins","Buffalo Sabres","Calgary Flames","Carolina Hurricanes","Chicago Blackhawks","Colorado Avalanche","Columbus Blue Jackets",
"Dallas Stars","Detroit Red Wings","Edmonton Oilers","Florida Panthers","Los Angeles Kings","Minnesota Wild","Montreal Canadiens","Nashville Predators","New Jersey Devils",
"New York Islanders","New York Rangers","Philadelphia Flyers","Pittsburgh Penguins","Ottawa Senators","San Jose Sharks","St Louis Blues","Tampa Bay Lightning","Vancouver Canucks",
"Washington Capitals","Winnipeg Jets"]

'Setting Up The Schedules'
#Adds Some Extra Team Matchups To The Mix
while not len(teams) == 82:
    try:
        teams.append(teams[random.randint(1,30)])
    except IndexError:
        break


#Creating The Schedule
schedule = random.sample(teams, len(teams))
teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
'Setting Up The Schedules'


'Actually Simulating A Season'
determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
leafswins = 0
leafslosses = 0
game = 1

while len(schedule) > 0:
	iswon = False
	teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
	determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

	if teambeingplayed == "Anaheim Ducks":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	[...]

	elif teambeingplayed == "Winnipeg Jets":
		iswon = determinesawinornot > 95:

	if iswon:
		leafslosses += 1

	else:
		leafswins += 1

	game += 1
	schedule.pop(0)
	print(f'Game {game} Was Played Against The {teambeingplayed} The Leafs {"Won" if iswon else "Lost"}')

print("Leafs Won", leafswins, "game")
print("Leafs Lost", leafslosses, "game")
```

The first thing that I notice is the following.

```py
'Setting Up The Schedules'
#Adds Some Extra Team Matchups To The Mix
while not len(teams) == 82:
    try:
        teams.append(teams[random.randint(1,30)])
    except IndexError:
        break


#Creating The Schedule
schedule = random.sample(teams, len(teams))
teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
```

I shouldn't need a while loop to run. Knowing the list of teams, I can merely select random ones untill I have 82.

It can be written accordingly.

```py
#Creating The Schedule
schedule = [random.choice(teams) for _ in range(len(82))]
teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
```

Something that I really don't enjoy is the repetitivness of the `iswon` checks.

To fix this, I can turn the `teams` list into a dictionary.

```
teams = {'Anaheim Ducks': 95, 'Arizona Coyotes': 5, 'Boston Bruins': 25, 'Buffalo Sabres': 95, 'Calgary Flames': 50, 'Carolina Hurricanes': 33, 'Chicago Blackhawks': 50, 'Colorado Avalanche': 50, 'Columbus Blue Jackets': 67, 'Dallas Stars': 50, 'Detroit Red Wings': 75, 'Edmonton Oilers': 95, 'Florida Panthers': 63, 'Los Angeles Kings': 95, 'Minnesota Wild': 50, 'Montreal Canadiens': 95, 'Nashville Predators': 5, 'New Jersey Devils': 95, 'New York Islanders': 33, 'New York Rangers': 50, 'Philadelphia Flyers': 83, 'Pittsburgh Penguins': 67, 'Ottawa Senators': 25, 'San Jose Sharks': 95, 'St Louis Blues': 25, 'Tampa Bay Lightning': 33, 'Vancouver Canucks': 75, 'Washington Capitals': 67, 'Winnipeg Jets': 95}
```

As a result however, I need to make one small change in the schedule creation.

```py
schedule = [random.choice(list(teams.keys())) for _ in range(82)]
```

However, this allows me to remove the rather long `if` clause.

```py
import random
from os import system
from time import sleep #used for some aesthetics and style

teams = {'Anaheim Ducks': 95, 'Arizona Coyotes': 5, 'Boston Bruins': 25, 'Buffalo Sabres': 95, 'Calgary Flames': 50, 'Carolina Hurricanes': 33, 'Chicago Blackhawks': 50, 'Colorado Avalanche': 50, 'Columbus Blue Jackets': 67, 'Dallas Stars': 50, 'Detroit Red Wings': 75, 'Edmonton Oilers': 95, 'Florida Panthers': 63, 'Los Angeles Kings': 95, 'Minnesota Wild': 50, 'Montreal Canadiens': 95, 'Nashville Predators': 5, 'New Jersey Devils': 95, 'New York Islanders': 33, 'New York Rangers': 50, 'Philadelphia Flyers': 83, 'Pittsburgh Penguins': 67, 'Ottawa Senators': 25, 'San Jose Sharks': 95, 'St Louis Blues': 25, 'Tampa Bay Lightning': 33, 'Vancouver Canucks': 75, 'Washington Capitals': 67, 'Winnipeg Jets': 95}

'Setting Up The Schedules'

#Creating The Schedule
schedule = [random.choice(list(teams.keys())) for _ in range(82)]
teambeingplayed = schedule[0]

'Actually Simulating A Season'
determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)
leafswins = 0
leafslosses = 0
game = 1

while len(schedule) > 0:
    iswon = False
    teambeingplayed = schedule[0]
    determinesawinornot = random.randint(1,100)

    iswon = determinesawinornot > teams[teambeingplayed]

    if iswon:
    	leafslosses += 1

    else:
    	leafswins += 1

    game += 1
    schedule.pop(0)
    print(f'Game {game} Was Played Against The {teambeingplayed} The Leafs {"Won" if iswon else "Lost"}')

print("Leafs Won", leafswins, "game")
print("Leafs Lost", leafslosses, "game")
```

Now, I've gone from 134 lines to 37 lines.
