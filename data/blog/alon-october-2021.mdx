- 2021-22 Upper Deck Tim Hortons Hockey Cards are coming out on Wednesday, October 27.

  - Buy?
  - Each pack has:
    - 2 base cards
    - 1 insert
    - (for the most part)
  - 200 packs = $410-$420
  - This gives me:
    - 400 base cards
    - 200 inserts
    - (for the most part)

- Implications
  - I can 100% complete one base set, nearly complete another
  - I can complete a decent amount of insert sets
  - I have a shit load of cards I can trade
- The idea:
  - Sell a few websites
  - Buy both boxes
  - Break them open
  - Join the hockey card community and start trading
- Why?
  - For fun
  - Revive an old hobby that I still very much enjoy
  - Join a community of people I've wanted to be a part of for a long time
  - FINALLY FINISH ONE OF THESE FUCKING SETS
