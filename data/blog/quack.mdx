You can take a look at the final code and a summarized version of this article [here](https://github.com/TSharvananthan/quack).

## Why?

I want duck.

## My Objective

By the end of this, you will be able to get a duck picture by entering `quack` on your terminal.

I will be using Ubuntu for this project. However, you can also follow what I'm doing if you are on Windows.

We will be using:

- The `requests` library to send HTTP requests.
- The PIL library to show the final image.
- The [Random-d.uk API](https://random-d.uk/api) to get random duck images.

## Assumptions

- You have already installed Python. Moreover for Windows users, it's one of your PATH variables.
- You have basic knowledge of using the command line.
- You understand variables and importing in Python

## What I Will Cover

- Installing the needed dependencies
- Creating the needed files
- Importing dependencies
- Sending and receiving HTTP requests
- Showing the image
- Bundling the program as an executable
- Setting up the executable to be run in the terminal
- Extra steps that you can take to improve the program

## Setup

### Installing The Needed Dependencies

There are a few dependencies that I would like to install.

[requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests): A library that lets us send HTTP requests (and does a lot of the not so fun networking work behind the hood)

[Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow): A library that lets us do image processing using Python. For this tutorial, we will be using Pillow to show the final image.

**NOTE**: There are so many libraries that can show images. However, I chose PIL for two reasons:

1. It's lightweight. There's no need for a big boy library for something like this.

2. PIL is just... COOL. It's a great first library for image processing and a lot of the resources are catered towards first time programmers.

[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller): A library that creates executable files from Python scripts.

You can install all three libraries at once using:

```text
pip3 install requests Pillow pyinstaller
```

### Creating The Needed Files

I highly recommend that you create a new directory just for this project. I chose to name my directory `quack`

This can be done in your command line with

```
mkdir quack
cd quack
```

You will only need a `quack.py` file for this tutorial. This is where you will do all of your work.

Create said file with however method you wish.

Your directory should look like this:

```text
quack
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.py
```

_(you can type `tree` to get an outline of your directory)_

Now we're ready to create our `quack` program.

## The Code

Open your `quack.py` script in whatever text editor/IDE that you would like. Let's begin.

### Importing Dependencies

![image.png](/post-assets/quack/1.png)

The two libraries that you will be using for now are PIL and requests. Import what we need.

```py
from PIL import Image
import requests
```

In theory, an image is just a string of data. Python doesn't directly understand images and what to do with them. [Image](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html) is a module that allows us to do such a thing. You can think about it as something that helps Python interpret what an image is.

### Getting A Random Image URL

![image.png](/post-assets/quack/2.png)

For this tutorial, we will be using the [/random](https://random-d.uk/api/random) endpoint to retrieve the URL of a random duck image.

You can do that by creating a variable :

```py
r = requests.get("https://random-d.uk/api/random")
```

`r` is the response that you got by sending a GET request to the URL.

At the same time, we would like to convert the response to a JSON format (in this situation, a Python dictionary).

That can be done by converting the response to JSON:

```py
r_json = r.json()
```

Something to note is that the endpoint returns a JSON object that looks something along the lines of:

```text
{
      "message": "Powered by random-d.uk",
      "url": "some_url"
}
```

All we need is the `url`. We can retrieve that key by declaring another variable that grabs said key from the response JSON.

```py
quack = r_json["url"]
```

At the moment, your program should look something along the lines of:

```py
from PIL import Image
import requests

r = requests.get("https://random-d.uk/api/random")
r_json = r.json()

quack = r_json["url"]
```

Now, we need to get the image from the URL

### Get The Duck Image

![image.png](/post-assets/quack/3.png)

If you recall, I mentioned that an image is just a set of binary data. At the same time, PIL.Image is able to take image binary data and make it manageable by Python.

All that we need to do is get said raw data from the URL.

First, we will send another GET request using the `quack` variable

```py
r2 = requests.get(quack, stream=True)
```

You will notice something different. More specifically, the `stream=True`. What... IS that you may ask?

In short, when you call `requests.get`, Python automatically interprets the response. However, all that we need is the image data.

`stream=True` ensures that the final response is the raw data.

You can then save said data by calling `.raw` to another variable

```py
r2_raw = r2.raw
```

By now, your program should look something along the lines of:

```py
from PIL import Image
import requests

r = requests.get("https://random-d.uk/api/random")
r_json = r.json()

quack = r_json["url"]

r2 = requests.get(quack, stream=True)
r2_raw = r2.raw
```

The final step is to utilize `PIL.Image` to interpret and show the image data.

### Showing The Image

We will declare one final variable:

```py
im = Image.open(r2_raw)
```

`im` is an instance of PIL.Image that interpreted the raw data.

At the same time, `im` allows you to show the image. That is done by calling

```py
im.show()
```

### The Final Code

Your program should look like the following

```py
from PIL import Image
import requests

r = requests.get("https://random-d.uk/api/random")
r_json = r.json()

quack = r_json["url"]

r2 = requests.get(quack, stream=True)
r2_raw = r2.raw

im = Image.open(r2_raw)
im.show()
```

if you run the program, you will notice that a duck image will appear.

## Configuring The `quack` Command

One problem with our current implementation is that we aren't able to run `quack` as a command.

If you try, the command isn't recognized by the terminal.

We can solve this with two simple steps

1. Create an executable (.exe files for windows users) from the program using `pyinstaller`
2. This step varies on operating system. If you are on Windows, you add the .exe as a PATH variable and resetting your PC. If you are on Ubuntu, you add a new alias to `~/.bashrc` and resetting the terminal.

### Creating The Executable

![image.png](/post-assets/quack/5.png)

Remember when we installed `pyinstaller`? Here is where we make use of it.

On the command line, make sure that you're in the directory where `quack.py` is saved.

Type in the following command

```text
pyinstaller --onefile quack.py
```

After about a minute or two, you will see three new things.

- build: Files that assist in creating the executable.
- dist: The final executable.
- quack.spec: Specific settings that are applied when the executable is created.

Your directory should look something along the lines of:

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.py
â”œâ”€â”€ build
â”œâ”€â”€ dist
    â”œâ”€â”€ quack (or quack.exe if you're on Windows)
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.spec
```

You can also declutter your project by removing unneeded files.

- Remove the `build` directory and all it's contents.

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.py
â”œâ”€â”€ dist
    â”œâ”€â”€ quack/quack.exe
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.spec
```

- Move `quack`/`quack.exe` out of `dist` and into the main project directory.

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.py
â”œâ”€â”€ dist
â”œâ”€â”€ quack/quack.exe
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.spec
```

- You are free to remove the `dist` directory.

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.py
â”œâ”€â”€ quack/quack.exe
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.spec
```

- You can also remove `quack.spec`

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ quack.py
â”œâ”€â”€ quack/quack.exe
```

By now, you should only have two files: the python program (`quack.py`) and the executable (`quack` or `quack.exe`).

### Quackifying The Command Line

The final step is to configure the executable to be accessible by the command line. This step varies by operating system. If you are using a system besides Windows and Ubuntu, feel free to research the desired method.

An appropriate prompt to Google is _adding executable to path [operating system]_

#### Windows

You need to copy the full path of `quack.exe`. One way of doing this is to

- Open the File Explorer and navigate to the project folder

- Right click the .exe file and click "properties"
  ![image.png](/post-assets/quack/6.png)

- Copy the "Location" property
  ![image.png](/post-assets/quack/7.png)

Search "Edit the system environment variables" and click the first result
![image.png](/post-assets/quack/8.png)

Click "Environment Variables..."
![image.png](/post-assets/quack/9.png)

Double click "Path"
![image.png](/post-assets/quack/10.png)

Click "New" and paste in the file-path that you copied
![image.png](/post-assets/quack/11.png)

Click "Ok" until you've exited out of the settings page.

Finally, open a new terminal and type `quack` to test if it works.

![image.png](/post-assets/quack/12.png)

#### Ubuntu

You will need to copy the full file path of `quack`. Assuming you have a terminal with the project directory open, this can be done with two steps.

- Enter `pwd` and copy the path.
- Add `/quack` to the end of said path

In my situation. I get `/home/t/python/quack` when I enter `pwd`. The final result is `/home/t/python/quack/quack`. I copied that to my clipboard.

Once you do that, find a way to open `~/.bashrc` in a text editor.

Personally, I entered `gedit ~/.bashrc` in the terminal.

At the bottom of the program, enter the following:

```text
# Quack program
alias quack=[the final path that you copied]
```

Note that while it isn't necessary to add the comment, it's just nice to have long term in case you forget. Moreover, it creates a sense of separation between the other configuration settings.

Save and exit the file.

On your terminal, you can enter `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

Type `quack` to test if it works.
