## Overview <a id="overview" />

These are notes that I took for Joel Spolsky’s **Smart and Gets Things Done**. However, many of said notes take the perspective of an aspiring developer. In other words, much of the written advice reflects actions that a developer can take to get a position.

## Introduction <a id="introduction" />

- Hiring is an elimination course
- A lot of people have...
  - ... never heard of your company
  - ... don’t know what you’re hiring
  - ... live far from your offices
  - ... got the interview and bombed
  - ... had other offers
  - ... have imposter syndrome

## Chapter 1 - Hitting The High Notes <a id="chapter-1" />

- The real goal is for software companies to convert capital into software that works
- It’s worthwhile to hire good programmers.
  - it will show in the software → more people buy it → you can afford better programmers
  - Hire Brad Pitt and take the financial tank in exchange for the hype that will bring in people
- Quality of work does not correlate with amount of time spent
- Brooks’ Law, “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later”
  - The more programmers, the more coordination
- Software MUST be good (#2 doesn’t cut it). Thus, you NEED good programmers

## Chapter 2 - Finding Great Developers <a id="chapter-2" />

- Great software developers often connection their way into a job
- Great software developers are noticed early
  - SHOW that on Linkedin
- Why programmers get fired
  - Shit
  - Company goes awry
  - Both
- There do exist solid, competent programmers.
- Majority of resumes are shitty, incompetent programmers
- Three methods to finding developers
  - Climb mountains
  - Internships
  - Building a network
    - Find people that interact with your company websites
    - Go to tech conferences (company ones, open source ones, new tech ones)
  - General rule: Avoid general job board ads
- Find programmers that code in their free-time
- Ask your current developers and interns (NETWORK, NETWORK AND NETWORK)

## Chapter 3 - A Field Guide To Developers <a id="chapter-3" />

- Find developers that aren’t absolute cunts (not ALWAYS needed though)
  - A sort of leniency in regards to this
- Developers want something INTERESTING to work on
  - Show interest in company technologies
- Developers look into the social values of a company
  - Show that you match or enjoy the values of a certain company?
  - An issue is in being fake.

## Chapter 4 - Sorting Resumes <a id="chapter-4" />

- **RESUMES ARE WEAK INDICATOR OF COMPETENCE.**
- Resumes are sometimes used to _filter_ people out, not directly hire them
  - Tailoring resumes are important since they only help you get interviews
- Criteria for sorting resumes
  - **Passion**: Clear signs that the applicant has a strong interest towards computers. This may include: programming experience that goes far back, early applications of coding
  - **Extra Curricular Activities**: Projects that you worked on for fun
  - **New Technologies**: Showing new and rising technologies (Solidity, Rust, Go)
- In a cover letter, talk about the interest to work at a given company as much as you talk about yourself. It shows that:
  - The person isn’t applying to a fuck ton of jobs
  - Tells the company that you actually took your time with designing your application
- People that can communicate code are a **must**
- Looking for general smarts (GPA, other activities)
- Diversity plays a factor in effective hires since they offer new perspectives on old problems
- Specific technologies shouldn’t be considered when hiring people
  - The tech we use now will go obsolete in a few years
  - It’s not hard at all to learn new technologies
  - The one exception is a software lead or some kind of higher up

## Chapter 5 - The Phone Screen <a id="chapter-5" />

- Phone screens are good at weeding out people that are only paper smart
- Phone screens focus on the quality of what someone is saying
- Things to look for during a phone call
  - Their a problem solver
  - They have a lot of passion
  - They care about what they did
    - Technology: They know their shit for what they put down (2 years of Py experience? Better SOUND like you have 2 years)
    - Politics: How did someone handle challenges of all kinds (team based, coding issues, logistics)
    - TLDR; They have DETAILS ON A LOT OF WHAT THEY DID
- “The interview is as much a way for the candidate to decide if they want to work for us as it is a way for us to decide if we want to hire the candidate”
  - Assumes that the candidate specifically chose to apply for the company (instead of applying randomly)

## Chapter 6 - The Guerrilla Guide To Interviewing <a id="chapter-6" />

- Figure out who the _right_ programmers are for the job that you need to finish
  - Companies have different standards for what makes a “qualified” programmer
- Companies should go on a basis of “hire” and “not hired”
- Rejecting good candidate is FAR better then accepting a bad candidate
- Look for candidates that are **smart** and **get things done**
- What is smart:
  - No need to explain shit over and over again (flow)
- Shitty interviewers
  - Blowhard:
    - Gives no chance for the candidate to speak.
    - Hires everyone cause they share the same views
  - The Quiz Show Host:
    - “Knows a fuck ton of shit that you can google in 15 seconds?” “HIRED”
- Hire people that can learn shit FAST
- An example process of an interviewer
  - Intro
    - Warm up the interview
    - The initial impression can fuck you up (don’t get pre-interview impressions)
  - Recent projects/experiences
    - Look for passion, good explanations and signs of leadership
  - Easy programmer question
    - Warm-up to weed out people that lied
  - Hard programmer question
    - A demonstration of “can they handle multiple abstractions at once?”
    - Programmers should be able to handle understanding programming down to low level languages
  - Are you satisfied?
    - The most nightmarish question in the hiring process is “there’s a bug in your code”
    - The test is to see if one can catch the bug
  - Questions?
- Write hire/no hire a few MINUTES after the interview is done

## Chapter 7 - Fixing Sub-optimal Teams <a id="chapter-7" />

- There are different ways that one can contribute to a team
- Forms of management
  - **Command and Control** - Make people work cause of their fear for you. Pretty shitty ass idea by the way.
  - **Econ 101** - Assuming that everyone wants to work for money, give people money incentives. An issue is that you condition devs to only write good code when money is on the line
  - **Identity Management** - Use a series of methods to make devs identify with the company and the goals of said company. Basically, creating a family.

## The Joel Test <a id="joel-test" />

- Do you use source control?
  - Using Git and Github
- Can you make a build in one step?
  - Good teams have one script that builds and runs the project
- Do you make daily builds?
  - Basically, check if builds work everyday
- Do you have a bug database?
  - Organizing and managing bugs
  - Should include:
    - Complete steps to reproduce the bug
    - Expected behaviour
    - Observed (buggy) behaviour
    - Who it’s assigned to
    - Whether it has been fixed or not
- Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
  - Prioritizing bug fixing over writing new code
- Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
  - Avoids issues in logistics between departments (eg, business/PR)
- Do you have a spec?
  - In other words... DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
- Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
  - **_F O C U S_**
- Do you use the best tools money can buy?
  - Good tech → Productive environment
- Do you have testers?
  - 1 tester for every 2-3 programmers
- Do new candidates write code during their interview?
  - New candidates MUST show aspects of applications before being hiring
- Do you do hallway usability testing?
  - Hallway usability test - Get the first person that passes by a hallway to test what you wrote

Every “yes” is one point. This is rated out of a score of 12.

12/12 - Perfect | 11/12 - Tolerable | ≤10/12 - Kinda an issue
