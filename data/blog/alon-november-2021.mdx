- Miiduction
  - Identify the Miis that real people control
  - Battlefield is that of a Mii channel
  - 2-8 players
  - One person is the controller

## November 14th 2021

- Scalability Factor: Representing application scalability through math formulas
  - $S(x)$
  - Personal blogs/portfolios: $y=x$
  - Small businesses**: $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$**
  - E-Commerce: $y=x^2$
  - Social Media Platforms: $y=2^x$
  - $x$ represents changes needed | $y$ represents resource consumption
  - Just an idea to play with. The e-commerce one is probably pretty inaccurate
