## Overview

I applied for this frontend postion and they asked for some images of my portfolio.

I spent about three hours, taking screenshots and designing these simple infographics that showcase some projects that I was proud of.

I might as well show them.

## Background Colors

The background colors came from this palette that I took from a website.
