## Get out the rye bread and mustard, Grandma, it's a grand salami <a id="rye-bread" />
I saw the slap... you probably also saw the slap...

Quite a night if I say so myself.

I was just doing some school work when I randomly hopped on Twitter.

I take a quick glance at the trending page and notice

All of a sudden, I got to see Chris Rock get out the [rye bread and mustard for a slapami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYQwDgICug)... courtesy of Will Smith.

## Eel Slap! <a id="eel-slap" />
So I'm having quite a time scrolling through Twitter and seeing everyone's takes on it

And I'll be honest when I say that I have absolutely no idea why this next bit happened... but I was somehow reminded of [Eel Slap!](http://eelslap.com)

I don't even remember where it came from... it wasn't even the idea of the slap that reminded me of it

I think I was just scrolling through *god knows where* and just happened to find it.

All of a sudden...

<p className="text-center text-6xl leading-none">ðŸ’¡</p>

***Why don't I just... MAKE A CLONE OF THIS***

## Observations <a id="observations" />
The first thing I did was to take a look at the Eel Slap source code

For some context... this is how the page looks like

![A screenshot of Eel Slap!](/post-assets/slap-chris-rock/1.png)

The main detail is some kind of canvas that's placed in the center of the webpage.

In other words, much of the state will be applied onto that one canvas.

I found the block of code that held this "canvas"

```html
<div id="eelcontainer" class="eel">
    <div id="loader">LOADING...</div>
    <div id="introtext">yo</div>
    <div id="allimages">
        <img class="eelimages" id="eelimage1" src="" width="15360" height="480">
        <img class="eelimages" id="eelimage2" src="" width="14720" height="480">
        <img class="eelimages" id="eelimage3" src="" width="15360" height="480">
        <img class="eelimages" id="eelimage4" src="" width="14720" height="480">
    </div>
</div>
```

Turns out, it's a `<div>` with... four images?

At first, it caught me off guard.

However, from inspecting the state of the container, I noticed that the CSS of the `allimages` kept changing.

At first, the code looked like the following:

```html
<div id="allimages" style="display: block; opacity: 1; left: 0px;">
```

However, if I finish the slapping animation, the CSS would look the following:

```html
<div id="allimages" style="display: block; opacity: 1; left: -59520px;">
```

From seeing this, there were two observations that I could make.

1. The animation effect comes from a series of frames being shifted... sorta like how old films would be played by shifting individual frames.
2. There are multiple images being used to complete this effect.

Inspecting the image links would further confirm this.

![The last panorama that Eel Slap! makes use of](/post-assets/slap-chris-rock/5.png)

<p className="text-center text-6xl font-extrabold">Eureka</p>

Something else to note is that I wouldn't need to go out of my way to splice the frames into multiple images.

Given that the slap is quite short, my gut told me that it wasn't needed.

At this point, it was a matter of implementing the damn site.

## No... depandancies? <a id="no-depandancies" />
I genuinely asked myself if it was worthwhile to use React or Next.

While it made the bootstrap process a tad easier, I found that it would make my life a WHOLE lot easier by using raw HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Besides, for a website as small as this, using a framework and all it's boilerplate would be over-engineering it.

## BUILD BUILD BUILD BUILD BUILD <a id="build" />
Lemme break this process down into it's needed steps
### Getting the frames <a id="getting-the-frames" />
The process behind this was surprisingly easy. It was just a matter of:

1. Downloading the Youtube video using something like `youtube-dl`

`youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myjEoDypUD8 -o slap.mp4`

Note that I only look for 1280x720 videos. I just find it easy that way...

However, some videos may not download as 1280x720 on default.

So how exactly do I counter that???

Well... `youtube-dl` solves that problem by letting us choose.

I can type the following command:

`youtube-dl -F https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myjEoDypUD8`

That gives me the following...

```

```

(Note that there's more to the right that I deleted. However, this is the information that's needed)

My criteria is the following:
    1. The extension is mp4
    2. The resolution is 1280x720
    3. The quality is as high as it can get

Furthermore, I can find the format code that I need (in this situation, 22) and enter the following

`youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myjEoDypUD8 -o slap.mp4`

2. Cutting the video into an approximate range where the slap takes place.

`ffmpeg -ss 00:00:33 -to 00:00:42  -i slap.mp4 -c copy cut.mp4`

(note that for the video above, that was the range that I found best. Reality is that with each video... the range changes)

(note note that I gave quite a generous range. While it results in more frames to sort out, I found it easier to deal with the frames then to re-clip the video every time I screw up)

3. Splitting the cut video into it's individual frames.

(I happen to have a `frames/` directory that I can make use of)

`ffmpeg -i cut.mp4 frames/%d.jpg -hide_banner`

4. Manually finding the best 41 frames

In regards to choosing good frames, there are a few points that I raised in the repo for this project that I would like to mention here as well.
    - A good starting frame would be a few frames right before the slap (maybe a few frames of the walk if REALLY needed).
    - A good ending frame would be a few frames right after the slap or after the gag.
    - Some slap memes are too long for it to work for an app like this... at the end of the day, it should stick to that 41 frame limit as I have absolutely no clue how to implement it in a way where it compensates for a frame count over/under the expected amount.

Once I got past the issue of downloading frames, it was quite smooth from there.

It was just a matter of making the website.

### The website <a id="the-website" />
I slapped together a quick webpage

```html
<body>
  <header class="text-center">
    <h1 class="title">slap chris rock</h1>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      &quot;It's like
      <a href="http://eelslap.com/" target="_blank">Eel Slap!</a>... but a
      <i>whole lot worse</i>&quot;
    </h3>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="image">
      <img src="frames/normal.jpg" id="slap" width="52480" height="680"
          draggable="false" />
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

Slapped together equally as fast CSS

```css
body {
  font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
  text-align: center;
}

.container {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1280px; height: 720px;
  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
  left: 0; right: 0;
	overflow: hidden;
  text-align: center;
}

.title {
  font-size: 8rem;
  line-height: 0px;
}

.subtitle { font-size: 2rem; }

#slap {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0px;
}

footer { font-size: 0.75rem; }
```

The Javascript was also rather simple to implement

```js
document.onmousemove = handleMouseMove;

let imageElement = document.getElementById("slap");

function handleMouseMove(event) {
    let pageWidth = document.documentElement.clientWidth;
    let dividingFactor = pageWidth / 40;
    let imageNum = 40 - Math.round(event.pageX / dividingFactor);
    setTimeout(() => {
      imageElement.style.left = `${imageNum * -1280}px`;
    }, 100)
}
```

There are some parts of the handleMouseMove function that I would like to make note of

```js
let dividingFactor = pageWidth / 40;
```
A question that I need to ask is "how can I determine the image to show based on your mouse position".

Let's approach this with an example.

Lets say your screen is 1980x1080.

It would look something along the lines of this:

![A panorama that Eel Slap! makes use of](/post-assets/slap-chris-rock/6.png)

One approach is to split the monitor into 40 sections.

![A panorama that Eel Slap! makes use of](/post-assets/slap-chris-rock/7.png)

Whatever section that the mouse is in, you just show that image.

For instance, if the mouse is on the fourth section, you show the fourth last frame (given that it's moving from right to left).

However, an issue arises once the screen gets smaller.

![A panorama that Eel Slap! makes use of](/post-assets/slap-chris-rock/8.png)

Note how there aren't 40 sections anymore. What... happened?

In short, certain parts of the grid can't be seen.

![A panorama that Eel Slap! makes use of](/post-assets/slap-chris-rock/9.png)

<figcaption className="text-center">Kinda like this image!</figcaption>

The issue with this is that certain frames will never be reached. As a result, the movement won't be completely shown.

The simple fix is to calculate the number of pixels that each section needs.

`dividingFactor` represents this number of pixels.

```js
let imageNum = 40 - Math.round(event.pageX / dividingFactor);
```
This equation can further be broken down

***Math.round(event.pageX / dividingFactor)***

`event.pageX` represents the x coordinate of the mouse in the moment. By dividing it with the dividingFactor, I'm asking: "what section am I in at the moment"

For instance, if my mouse was all the way to the left, that implies that `event.pageX` would be a value close to 0

As a result, I would like to show the first frame.

I round the value in order to achieve this and create a whole number.

***40 - Math.round(event.pageX / dividingFactor)***

The issue with our previous statement is that I don't intent for the mouse to move from *left to right*.

Rather, I'd like it to be the opposite.

By shifting my previous value by 40, it ensures that I get an image based on movement from *right to left*.

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  imageElement.style.left = `${imageNum * -1280}px`;
}, 100)
```
So okay... I shifted the panoramic image to the left. Since the video was 1280 pixels wide, the subsequent frames are also 1280 pixels wide.

As a result, when you shift the image to the left with a factor of -1280, you're moving to another frame.

But why the timeout event? When I first built the site, I noted how quickly the frames would transition itself. I wanted to have some kind of pause so that when the user moves the mouse, it gives a better illusion of *"as you move your mouse, you get to slap Chris Rock"*.

### Some animations :D <a id="some-animations" />
So now that the basic site is done, there IS one small change that I can make.

I can add some... ANIMATIONS :D.

This was my first time using [animate.css](https://animate.style).

Yet, it went as smooth as expected.

The changes were so minimal... it would be difficult to notice

```html
<body>
  <header class="text-center animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">
    <h1 class="title">slap chris rock</h1>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      &quot;It's like
      <a href="http://eelslap.com/" target="_blank">Eel Slap!</a>... but a
      <i>whole lot worse</i>&quot;
    </h3>
  </header>

  <div class="container animate__animated animate__fadeIn">
    <div class="image">
      <img src="frames/normal.jpg" id="slap" width="52480" height="680"
            draggable="false" />
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

## Some Things I Can Improve
There a few things that I could definitely improve upon.
    1. Better variable names: I don't really need to explain this. Can generally refactor code.
    2. A more responsive design: I would definitely like to add mobile support sometime in the future.
    3. Adding more variations: I already have a few panoramic images. I just need to implement some kind of selection system.

All in all, pretty nice project to make. Had some fun doing it.

You can find the code on [Github](https://github.com/TSharvananthan/slap-chris-rock)
