summary: Who am I? What do I plan? Why did I name my blog accordingly?

I don't have much to say. Hope everyone's doing well.

I've procrastinated on building a blog for quite a while. I remember first learning to code in 2019 and wanting to write.

From a young age, I've always enjoyed writing. I still remember being inspired by the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series to write in my own personal journal.

Here's a bit about me.

## Who Am I?
I write code.

## What Am I Doing With This Blog?
I have a few goals
- I want a way to show off my programming skills
- I look to track my coding abilities with dev logs.

Here's the thing... I'm probably just gonna go with the flow... write whatever comes into my mind and generally have a more free-form approach to this.

I spent WAY too long making blogs that had some kind of format... some kind of schedule that I was required to follow. However, I could never quite stick the landing and ended up not publishing in a blog at all.

I look to go at a pace that I enjoy and write more for the fun of it.

## Adventure Capitalist... Really??

  <div>
    <p> So as you can see, I've had this name for quite some time. </p>
    <p> Hell, you can check out my attempt at writing a blog over on [Hashnode](https://than.hashnode.dev) </p>
    <p> But you may ask... </p>
    <blockquote> Why did you name it "Adventure Capitalist" on Hashnode? </blockquote>
    <p> So when I first wanted to write a blog, I had never really thought of... A NAME. </p>
    <p> With every other try, I always named it something close to my name </p>
    <p> However, there was something in me that wanted something NEW... AND FANCY </p>
    <p> It was pretty convenient as well... I happen to think about ways I could make money </p>
    <p> All of a sudden... it clicked... </p>
    <b> Adventure Capitalist </b>
  </div>

<br />

There's still a considerable amount of things that I would like to change. However, I've come to a point where...

<p className="text-center text-2xl font-extrabold"> I JUST WANT A PERSONAL BLOG UP. </p>

I understand that I COULD use some site like Medium or Hashnode.

But... meh, I just want something personal to write off of.

Besides... I can always republish on one of those sites.

## Final Thoughts
Enjoy? Or don't enjoy it... if that's your cup of tea.

There's still a lot in which I can iterate from. However... it's something I'll work on after a few blog posts.

For now, good day... or night... man I hate closing out blog posts...
