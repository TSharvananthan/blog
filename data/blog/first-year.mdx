About two weeks ago, I finished my first year as a math major at Toronto Metropolitan University.

There were a considerable number of road blocks along the way. COVID being the big one. Yet, I've come past them all.

I can finally enjoy a life without COVID, I was able to knock out some tough classes and I met many wonderful people.

This post is a (pretty long) look back on this year. The classes that I took,

## My Classes

I took 10 classes this year. They can be broken down accordingly...

```
10 classes
|_ 7 required classes
|   |_ Computer Science 1
|   |_ Discrete Mathematics 1
|   |_ Calculus 1
|   |_ Calculus 2
|   |_ Linear Algebra
|   |_ Orientation
|_ 2 Science Classes
|   |_ General Chemistry 1
|   |_ Computer Science 2
|_ 2 Liberal Classes
    |_ Understanding Crime in Canadian Society
    |_ Zap, Pow, Bang: Pop Lit
```

At the same time, I dropped two classes

```
|_ Discrete Mathematics 2
|_ Intro To Spanish
```

Here, I will break down each of these classes, how I felt about them and my grades in each class.

### Computer Science 1

**Grade: A+**

Computer Science 1 can be considered as a typical "intro to programming" course with Python.

For me, this class was chill.

Given that I knew Python beforehand, I didn't need to worry about learning a new concept.

As a result, I didn't attend classes. It didn't help that it was fully online.

Anytime there was class I would be out with my friends, having fun.

However, there were weekly labs that required you to be in class.

At FIRST, I tried to get them all done.

By the time we reached the end of the year, I couldn't be bothered.

This class was a real GPA saver if I'm being honest.

Once you take a look at my other classes, you'll see this especially.

Moral of the story? Chill class.

By chill class, I mean class that I skipped... all the time...

(totally not any sort of foreshadowing or anything)

### Discrete Mathematics 1

**Grade: B-**

My relationship with discrete math is... complicated to say the least.

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the concepts.

Regardless of whether I understood the concepts or not, I enjoyed studying them.

It's just that... my god... there were **so many concepts**.

By the first test, it threw me quite off guard.

Granted, a 75% isn't THAT BAD...

However, one issue... I just... forgot to... STUDY.

That's a lie... I didn't forget...

Ye ole' high school mentality came and kangaroo punched me across the face.

By the second test I was just writing random words and letters and greek and hoped for the best.

Of course, I got a mark that matches writing random words and letters and greek.

To make a long story short, I pulled through by my third test...

At the end of the day, I can't really hate this class.

At the same time, I don't think I would go very far doing discrete math...

### Calculus 1

**Grade: B-**

![A TA gave me a 200% on a quiz by accident](/post-assets/first-year/4.png)

<figcaption className="text-center">I joked that a 200% would be factored into my grade</figcaption>

I don't have much to say about this class.

The summer that preceded this class, I spent most of it practising single variable calculus.

I don't really know why I did either.

I suppose that it was because I was online for the last part of grade 12??

Even then... WHY CALCULUS?

That goes past this post.

Since I studied a lot of calculus beforehand, I told myself "I don't need to study".

So I didn't.

I definitely could have done better.

Even an HOUR a day wouldn't have killed me.

But... NOPE. I let my ego get the best of me with this class.

The professor was also rather laid back.

### Calculus 2

**Grade: D**

A couple lines ago, I mentioned how I let my ego control me.

GUESS WHAT? It carried into calc 2... the WORST class to have ego in.

Calc 2 was a saga in it's own right.

### Linear Algebra

**Grade: C+**

### Orientation

**Grade: PASSED**

### General Chemistry 1

**Grade: B-**

### Computer Science 2

**Grade: Calculus**

### Understanding Crime in Canadian Society

**Grade: B-**

### Zap, Pow, Bang: Pop Lit

**Grade: B+**

### Discrete Mathematics 2

**DROPPED**

### Intro To Spanish

**DROPPED**

## Lesson I Learnt

### Start Studying Early

### Commuting SUCKS

### Good Profs Make Hard Courses Manageable

### FOMO Is Just An Illusion

### Labs Matter

### Ego Doesn't Create Progress
