The other day, I wanted to scrape a list of courses that my university offers. By the end of it, I had a list of **3507** courses from **158** course sections.

A course string consists of two parts.

1. Course section
2. Course number

For example, CPS109 implies that

- The section is Computer Science (CPS)
- The course number is 109

Below are the number of courses that every section offers sorted from greatest to least.
