summary: Atom's great demise and how I defended it for so long.
---

I was doing my daily scroll of Hacker News when I learnt about GitHub throwing Atom in the back burner. To say the least, a few years of ignorance that I had finally got some closure. It was the first editor that isn't Notepad or Notepad++ that I used to write code.

I always had people that asked me about it.

> Why would you use it?

> Which psycho doesn't use VSCode... or emacs... or vim... or ed... or cat... or hell... even BUTTERFLIES.

For a long time, I made up a story about how I loved how "hackey" it felt. In reality, I was so used to using it that I figured switching would take a long time.

However, the times would change and VSCode became an enticiing option.

It felt like I was getting closer and closer to appeasing this feeling of guilt.

> There's no way I would leave right?! after ALL THE YEARS OF DEFENDING IT???

I felt like I was betraying someone near and dear to me. it felt like family. Then I snapped back into reality, realized that it's just another text editor and went "fuck it".

I swapped to VSCode with absolutely no hesitation whatsoever.

Two weeks pass and we return to that daily scroll on Hacker News. After seeing the news, I... wasn't that surprised if I'm being honest.

Don't get me wrong, it felt like I had a personal connection with the damn editor. However, I didn't.

It's kinda like that one friend that only really stands out to you because their around you all the time and when they leave, you realize how mundane and boring they truely are and you just move on with your life.

Lesson learnt? Use whatever the fuck gets the job done (don't quote me on this)

Fun fact, the only reason why I downloaded VSCode for the first time was because I had read about the "Hot Dog Stand" theme on Windows 3.1 and thought two things...

1. It sucked

2. I had to try it out for myself.

One problem, I DIDN'T WANT TO DOWNLOAD WINDOWS 3.1.

I figured that the closest option that I had was to download the Atom theme of it. Another problem, IT DIDN'T EXIST. as a result, VSCode entered my system...

... well not MY system... but my computer's system.

Anyways, the theme was as awful as I expected it to be.

It's funny because when I downloaded VSCode to make good use of it, I forgot that I had set the theme to "Hot Dog Stand". So, when I go to load the editor, it felt as if the sun was right beside me, giving me bro high fives and handing around.

To say the least, my eyes were SORE. They were burning CALORIES staring at that screen.

What made it worse was that I STILL tried to use the editor. I figured that it wouldn't be THAT bad.

You know, I sometimes wonder why I have such bad eyes... it's a real tragedy.

Rest in piece Atom, you open source bastard.

I hope that GitHub hell has a comfy spot for you to pull the hairs out of fellow demonic developers that have the AUDACITY to install an Atom package.

Some side tangents:

- I remember telling the news to a buddy that argued with me about Atom vs VSCode for two years. I never felt my pride be so seethed and offended for something as insignificant as software that helps me write code.

- I am not calling any of my other programmer friends with regards to this. I can only take so much before this drives me insane.

- The constant back and forth of "I don't care" and "I do care" is me coping... over something I DON'T CARE ABOUT.
